                        <h3>Our Mission</h3>
                        <p>Decentralization is entering nearly every facet of life as we know it and will continue for the foreseeable future. We believe charity should be no different. Decentralizing how we donate will help emerging charities to advocate, advertise and receive donations via The GIV Foundation and our Community. The Giving platform was created to allow people from around the globe to share, invite and vote on reputable charities to receive donations.
Charitable organizations that provide for smaller & lesser-known causes, constantly need donations to jumpstart and complete their mission. Non-Profits, resolving real-world challenges, now have a platform to gain recognition from a community of individuals that actively seek reputable charities in which they determine the allocation of all funds raised.

We love the idea of newcomers entering the game and organizing foundations that give back. That’s why we created the Giving Pool & The $GIV Token.

With a community-driven foundation, The Giving Platform allows for:</p>

<h3>the importance of charity</h3>
<p>Charity is the idea of giving out resources - like currency - to groups dedicated in saving our world’s vast ecosystem.  Each charity has a mission to ensure the protection of human rights and environmental safety. These selfless acts of giving bring out our natural ability to evolve as a species. By harvesting the power of community, people of all backgrounds and generations come together in unity to sustain peace and justice for the lives of others. The incredible generosity of these individuals results in positive transformation throughout our world.śThis act of kindness has been around for hundreds of years mainly preserving public health, poverty, and inequality.</p>

<h3>raising awareness</h3>
<p>Over 100,000 associations are actively organizing charity work throughout the globe today. With big names like the Welcome Trust Foundation, Red Cross, St Judes and others taking the spotlight it is sometimes difficult for newer and smaller groups to get the recognition they need. We created the Giving Foundation to promote charities of all categories and enter them to receive donations.</p>

<h3>Core Foundation of GIV</h3>
<p>It all begins with our unique approach to creating a platform and community that constantly fundraises for charitable groups while rewarding token holders. We accomplished this vision by inventing the $GIV Token & The Giving Pool. People from around the world will gather and bring recognition to a diverse variety of charitable associations via our Telegram & Discord channel. Our GIV Admins will carefully review and choose worthy candidates to be entered into our Tally List.</p>
<p>Once an organization is verified, our Discord Community will vote for who is featured in the Giving Pool and all $GIV Token Holders will be eligible to vote on who receives that donation.Visit www.TheGivingPool.io  to view the Pools statistics and Tally List.</p>

<h3>The Importance of The Giving Pool</h3>
<p>There are tons of known and unknown charities out there in need of funding for many different projects. We aim to generate ETH for these associations actively solving real-world concerns and empowering resolve. Here is a place where the community has the power to choose what their money is allocated towards.</p>

<h3>The Giving Pool</h3>
<p>Written in $GIV Token’s smart contract is a 10% tax on every transaction. 5% of that tax is converted into ETH and sent to a wallet that represents “The Giving Pool.” The purpose of this pool is  to reach  a  certain  amount  of  ETH, at  which  point  it  will be  automatically  donated  to the  verified  charity  that  is chosen by the  community. </p>

<h3>How Charities Are Chosen</h3>
<p>By the community, of course. Charities of all sorts are encouraged to detail the work they’ve done and what they plan to do if THE GIVING POOL were to support their vision. They can post live in our discord to the community in our AMA sessions which will allow users and holders to find out more about the mission and why they need the funds to achieve it. Every cycle, our admins will review all charities presented by the community and release a poll to users in our Discord and Telegram servers. Voting will take place, bringing to the light local and national charities that are important to our community. From here, there will be a round of research and approval of those who rise to the top.</p>

<h3>The Tally List</h3>
<p>Trending candidates throughout the GIV community  are entered as the final selection to be featured as the pool’s contestants. As the  pool is  filling, if  you’re  a  token  holder, you’ll be  able  to connect to the dApp  in order to prove  ownership of the $GIV Token.  The top voted will be the charity receiving the pools donation upon fulfillment.</p>

<h3>Charity Guidelines</h3>
<p>Pretty  important, right? There  are  a  lot  of  people  in  every  community. No matter what  happens, there  may always  be  non-qualifying  charities  that  are recommended to use to add  to our list. We will be  judging  every  charity  that  is  presented  with  three  simple  criteria that  allow  us  to determine, at  a  glance, whether  they  are  real contenders  for donation  or not  worth  our (or  the  community’s) time.</p>

<h3>Crypto-Friendly</h3>
<p>A charity must except crypto for donations before they are even considered eligible as a pool candidate..</p>

<h3>Tax Status</h3>
<p> It  is  not  an  end  all be  all since  we  have  the  goal of  helping  to raise  up lesser-known and  funded  charities, but  your current  tax  status, incorporation status, and/or  plans  for  both  will be  part  of  the  consideration  that  admins put  into whether or  not  you can  be  considered.</p>

<h3>The Giving Token (GIV)</h3>
<p> the purpose of the giv token is to self-generate fiscal and tangible value for participants and beneficiaries.  ecosystem functions because of Giv Token’s unique smart contracts and values</p>
<p>$GIV is necessary for providing a constant stream of funding into the Giving Pool, thus automating the gift of donation while generating  rewards holders. </p>
<p>$giv is a solana token Giv  and did not hold back when taking advantage of the networks resourceful framework.</p>
<p>The features of the token stem from the community and token holders. Upon each trade of giv, there is a built in  fee that powers to sustains The giving foundations ecosystem. </p>
<p>Each transaction has a 10% tax built that will be split in half, converted, and recycled into the community.
</p>
<p>. 5% will be swapped into SOL and sent to the Pool for funding.</p>
<p>. 5% will be swapped into USDT and redistributed into the wallets of Token Holders.
</p>
<p>additionally, We created  our unique Giveaway Wallet that will hold 20% of the circulating supply and will be locked to prevent selling.
  This giveaway wallet will collect rewards in USDT to host community giveaways of prizes and airdrops.</p>
<p>Here is  a  reward  system  built  into the  structure  of  the  token. As you hold, you will continually  be  rewarded. The bottom line, the $GIV Token  is much more than just an  investment, it’s a  tool  for giving. and receiving.  You can take part in giving back to those in need, while enjoying your investment and reward system.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>THE GIVING POOL and THE GIVING TOKEN have  a  simple  purpose. Decentralization  of  the  machine  that  is  charity. We  want  local and  lesser  known charities  with  the  best  intentions  &  less  overhead  to have  their  chance  to shine  and  put  more  of  the  users  dollars  into work for  the  end  user. The  ability  to invest  and  build  wealth  through  our  platform  is  a  pleasant  by-product of  this  vision. We hope you will consider getting  involved  in  THE GIVING POOL.</p>
